## Compiler ##
This repository has java code for an unoptimized compiler for a simple language called crux. The compiler
generates AT&T x86 assembly code. My partner and I are responsible for the code in:
* src/main/antlr4/crux/pt/Crux.g4
* src/main/java/crux/ast/ParseTreeLower.java
* src/main/java/crux/ast/types/*
* src/main/java/crux/ir/ASTLower.java
* src/main/java/crux/backend/CodeGen.java
